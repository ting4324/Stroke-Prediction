This machine learning project focuses on predicting the likelihood of stroke based on various health parameters. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes data to provide a stroke prediction. The Jupyter Notebook contains all the steps from data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

This project is a school project with 3 team members.
